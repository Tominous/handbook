*After the Lil Beast reset, The Nations folder is no longer synced with Google Drive.*
## Lil Beast
### Rules
- Render templates are in `Desktop/The Nations/Your Nation/Visualizer` - each visualizer version will be in a folder named `Version <v>`, v being the version number. In the folder, there'll be the .aep for your Nation visualizer. A few template assets *might* be there too.
- Rendered videos must be stored in `Desktop/The Nations/Your Nation/Rendered Videos`
- Temp video assets (song/bg) must be downloaded and saved to the `Clutter` folder on the Desktop. Please note that this folder gets automatically wiped every week.
- Global video/template assets are stored in `Desktop/Assets`
- Everything new/clutter on the Desktop *will* be deleted so be careful.
