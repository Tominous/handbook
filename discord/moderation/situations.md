# Situations
Every Moderator is expected to be prepared no matter the situation, so we keep this list updated with instances that happen both commonly and rarely in any and all communities.

## Abusive staff
 1. Alert @Phineas immediately  
 then
 2. Ask a `@Senior Moderator` or above to use `>role remove @mod 298600795560083456`  
 then
 3. Work to calm down any community members
